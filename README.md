CIS 191 Project 3
=================

This is a demo site that is a simplified version of the CIS 191 website. It is
used as a testbed/training ground for Git usage and merge conflict resolution.


Questions to answer
-----------------
  1 When I push to the server the git hook copies the files from the deploy branch to the www directory, and restarts the server in case of code changes.

  2 The www directory gets published online.

  3 A bare repository is a repository without a .git, and thusly without a working tree.
